    "<span style=\"color: navy;\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. **Introduction to LLM API Usage:** We have acquired skills in making API calls to OpenAI's GPT-3.5, specifically using the Chat Completion API to develop a simple AI tutor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Principles of Prompt Engineering:** Essential principles include **providing clear instructions** and **enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities**. We use structured prompts that include Task, Role, Context, Guidelines, and Output Format for clarity and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advanced Prompting Techniques:** Techniques like **Chain-of-Thought** and **Few-Shot prompting** aid in elaborating solutions step-by-step and providing examples of desired outputs, respectively. Additional methods like **self-consistency** and **ReAct prompting** help ensure reliable and contextually aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Designing LLM-Based Systems:** Beyond prompting techniques, we've explored safe design practices, including the use of OpenAI's moderation API to address unsafe queries and prompt injections. This groundwork prepares us for building our first LLM application, **CarAssist AI**, a chatbot designed to recommend cars based on key criteria.\n",
